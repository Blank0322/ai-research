# AI Research Notes

A small, public-friendly notebook repo for keeping *traceable* research notes.

Focus areas:
- agentic systems (tools, memory, scheduling)
- evaluation (offline + online)
- LLM reliability (prompting, uncertainty, guardrails)

## Structure

- `notes/` — short writeups (1–3 pages each)
- `papers/` — paper summaries
- `experiments/` — minimal runnable experiments (when possible)

## Conventions

- keep notes short and opinionated
- always write "what changed my mind" + "what I’d test next"
